Dennis - a platforms engineer. Based in Bulgaria. 25yo.

I have been mainly in operations through the years and I do not feel confident in my programming skills but I somehow manage to write code that is often shipped to production.

### My Interests:

- Platform Engineering: It's just cool and I seem to be good at it.
- Programming: It's way cooler but I am quite bad at it.
- AI/ML: Maybe I'm hype-blinded but this sh*t looks and feels super futuristic, almost magical.
- Writing: I just like sharing my views & having discussions with people online.

### My Projects:

- [geeklore.io](https://geeklore.io): A community platform, gamified with rpg elements. Features include badges, level & experience system, and a resume builder.
- [globchess.com](https://globchess.com): A global chess board where anyone can make the next move in the form of a token. One token costs $1. I wrote a very very bad code though so I need to update it and deploy again.
- [kubeden.io](https://kubeden.io): My baby project and personal blog. Built entirely for my own satisfaction with Golang, hosted on an ArgoCD Kubernetes cluster with CI/CD enabled.
