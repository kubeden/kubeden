                    is
                    strange. I tried doing some work on my non-employment projects, but it's not it... not today.

                    I had an amazing day with my girlfriend. We were doing "chores" but it didn't feel all that much
                    like chores, but like a time well-spent. However... I was constantly thinking about work and "how to
                    make it". At some point, during lunch, I got really inspired because of a chat we had, which made me
                    remember all the times I've been in the same situation, which were all memories of how I won:
